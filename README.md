# Manager Readme
_Editorial note - “Manager Readme’s” suffers from a poor name in my opinion. They work when the manager describes their management philosophy — they are not meant to be rules for how to interact with a manager or how to treat/coddle them._

Hi! I’m Scott. I live in Phoenix, Arizona with my wife and two kids. I’ve been in software development for about 20 years now (depending on how you want to count jobs during schooling) and management for the last 5ish.

I became a manager because I wanted to build a team and an environment that was awesome. I love seeing people come together and do stuff that they wouldn’t have been able to as individuals. 

I am an introvert. I like working with people and being on a team, so sometimes it seems like I’m an extrovert, but I recharge by being by myself. My own version of hell is to be sent to a “networking event” and told to mingle with strangers.

I’ve done various personality tests. My favorite was the [DiSC assessment](https://www.discprofiles.com/blog/2017/03/disc-personality-types/) which labeled me as a [Cd type](https://www.crystalknows.com/disc/cd-personality-type). I tend to be easy going, though when in stressful situations I take more direct control in order to make decisions faster (for better or worse…). I view personality evaluations as more for personal knowledge and **not** as a crutch or an excuse for bad behavior. If I’m labeled as being un-empathetic, that is something *I* need to work on, *not* something you need to tiptoe around. I’m not a freaking monarch, sheesh. 

## Let’s talk about you!
Ok, that was way too much about me.

One of the most important things I can do is create an environment of psychological safety. This means that my teams need to have the ability to have honest discussions about important things without fear of getting blasted for it. This dovetails nicely with Zapier’s core values.

This safety is built up over time. It’s kinda like a bank account. Each interaction between us has the possibility for me to build a little more trust, or remove it (usually in far bigger quantities). On further thought, that’s a good analogy. I can save up my money a little bit over time, and then in a single bad decision blow it all on a jet ski. 

How’re we gonna do this? A few ways. 

### 1:1s
I love a good 1:1. It’s a great opportunity to discuss anything. This could be silly hypothetical questions and ice-breakers, goals and progress, or just stuff like a recent movie you saw. 

These will mostly be driven by you. If I have something important to talk about I’ll bring it up, but otherwise it’s your show. Ideally you’ll add some points to Small Improvements before we meet, but time may not be on your side so that’s not mandatory. 

You can and should reach out beyond our 1:1s! I may not be able to respond to a request immediately but I will. If it’s really important, please hit me up repeatedly until you get my attention.

You can also put time on my calendar. If there’s a space, put a meeting on there. I block out a few hours in the evening for family-time but am otherwise pretty available. And if it’s really important you can override whatever meeting I may have gotten sucked into. 

### Honesty and Transparency
[I’m big on both of these](https://blog.swilliams.me/2018/12/11/my-recruiting-trick-the-good-the-bad-and-the-middle/). If you ask me a question I will answer it to the best of my capabilities. You may not be privy to certain types of information however. 

By default I choose to trust people and take them at their word. Yes, I have been bitten by this before, but it remains my policy. I don’t ever want to get into a habit of not trusting my team—that leads to disaster.

If there is ambiguity, I may ask clarifying questions. 

### Conflict
We may not see eye to eye on everything. Every situation is different. Sometimes one of us might need to [disagree and commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit). I acknowledge that the psychological size that comes with a title makes things tilted in my favor. Given all of that I make this promise to you: I will always hear you out and try to understand your point of view. If possible I will try to find a compromise in there. But you may not get your way every time, and I will not either.

### Performance & Feedback
And yeah, let’s talk about something that might be uncomfortable. Being a human you will go through highs and lows, and that is normal. This might mean that your work suffers. Part of my job is to recognize when you are in a funk and pull you out before it becomes critical. If I see some warning signs I’ll bring it up in a 1:1. 

When this happens: Breathe. Don’t panic.

I’ve been on the [receiving](https://blog.swilliams.me/2018/11/18/failure-and-ultimately-fixing-it/) end of this a few times so believe me, I can relate. The good news is that most things are fixable. We’ll talk about it. Maybe you were aware, maybe you weren’t, that’s ok. With an informal discussion like this, we’ll formulate a plan and I will help you through it. If things get better, then we’ll celebrate! If there isn’t improvement we’ll take a more direct approach (that’s outside the scope of this). 

#### This goes both ways
If we work closely together for long enough, I am going to let you down at some point, and I am sorry about that. Even though it may sound daunting I would really really appreciate it if you told me. I can make myself better by remaining accountable to you.

Here’s an anecdote from my past. We were architecting a fairly complex system with a few moving parts. When we were trying to figure out how long it would take to build to set client expectations I had over-simplified it in my head and threw out a number that was lower than what “Greg” had suggested. Then I did the bad manager thing and said “C’mon Greg, it won’t take _that_ long will it?” Of course Greg said no. Long story short, it did take that long. One of my other engineers, “Rick”, pulled me aside and said “You kinda steamrolled Greg back there about the estimate for the thing.” And he was right. I apologized to Greg and have tried to be more conscious about throwing my size around.

If Rick hadn’t done that, I would have missed an important opportunity to get better.

## The Work
### Guardrails and VUCA
There’s a cute acronym I heard before called VUCA. It stands for Volatility, Uncertainty, Confusion, and Ambiguity. Managers should be removing those, and certainly not introducing them. I agree with that, **but**, a certain amount of ambiguity in your life is a good thing — it makes you better when you navigate through it.

One analogy is that I should be building guardrails around your path. You may teeter around, or even cross lane lines… but you won’t careen off a cliff. The amount of allowable ambiguity also depends on how much experience you have too.

Lastly, you can always ask for more clarity or context. If I haven’t provided enough context, please please please ask for more! 

### Project Management
I’ve seen nearly every kind of project management philosophy there is. In my opinion there is no silver bullet when it comes to them, and being dogmatic about ‘Agile’ or anything just leads to unnecessary conflict. I view all of those things as tools to be used for the right occasion. Each team and project is different and needs a tailored approach. We’ll work together to figure that out for our teams, and then we’ll evaluate if it’s working and change when appropriate. Per Dave Thomas:

> What to do: Find out where you are.
> Take a small step towards your goal.
> Adjust your understanding based on what you learned.
> 
> Repeat.

### Notifications
Notifications will rule your life if you let them. I tend to be very nitpicky over what push notifications I allow on my phone especially. I only get alerts from Slack if someone mentions me directly. I also get alerts for SMS/iMessages. I do not have alerts for emails, social media, or many of the other common apps. I highly recommend you follow suit.

Please set yourself regular time to rest and recharge. I believe that continual extended hours is not healthy, for a person, or for a business. There may be times when we absolutely have to hit a deadline where extra time may be necessary, but that’ll be rare.

## My advice to managers new to my team
Be proactive. Don’t wait for 1:1s to get to know your direct reports. Hit them up on Slack and/or create :donut2: meetings with them. What’s their history? What are their goals? What do they like about Zapier and what drives them crazy? They will teach you far more about your job than I ever could. 

Get to know other managers here too. I highly recommend setting up an informal chat with as many as you can just to hear about what their teams do and how it all fits together. 

I’d also encourage you to expand beyond whatever boundaries you think you have right now. I see a lot of managers focus solely on their own individual team, which while good, puts limits on things. What are those boundaries and how can they be expanded? (This assumes a “good” kind of expansion and not annexing or taking over work from others). 

This ties into my final point. What is your vision for your team and for yourself? If you don’t have those, you should! Where do you want your team to be in a few years time and where do you want yourself to be? Periodically ask yourself if you’re moving in the right direction.
